This is a fork of haskell-names that has been changed to work with a modified version of haskell-src-exts.
If you are looking for the repository of the original haskell-names package, you can find it [here][suite-hsn].

haskell-names
=============

haskell-names does name and module resolution for haskell-src-exts AST.

Namely, it can do the following:

* For a list of modules, compute the list of symbols each module exports.
  This is called `resolve`.
* For each name in a module, figure out what it refers to â€” whether it's bound
  locally (say, by a `where` clause) or globally (and then give its origin).
  This is called `annotate`.

This specific fork of haskell-names is a part of [composable-types][cty], and has been modified to depend on [kirderf1/haskell-src-exts][hse].

Environments
-----------------

An environment is a map from module name to list of symbols the module exports.
Symbols are for example types, classes, functions etc. We persist these lists in
a JSON format.
For example, here are a couple of entries from `Prelude.names`:

``` json
[
  {
    "name": "map",
    "entity": "value",
    "module": "GHC.Base"
  },
  {
    "name": "IO",
    "entity": "newtype",
    "module": "GHC.Types"
  },
  ...
]
```

As you see, each entity is annotated with the module where it was
originally defined. Additionally, class methods, field selectors, and data
constructors are annotated with the class or type they belong to.

`haskell-names` provides functions `readSymbols` and `writeSymbols`
to read and write interface files.

Name resolution
---------------

The `annotate` function annotates the given module with scoping information.

Its essence is described in the article [Open your name resolution][openrec].

### Examples

The example in `examples/HeadUsage.hs` shows how you would find out if a
Haskell modules given on stdin uses `Prelude.head`.

```
% cabal exec -- runghc examples/HeadUsages.hs
one = head [1]
^D
Prelude.head is used at stdin: (1:7) - (1:11)

% cabal exec -- runghc examples/HeadUsages.hs
import Prelude hiding (head)
import Data.Text

f = head (pack "foo")
^D
Congratulations! Your code doesn't use Prelude.head
```

The example in `examples/ModuleExports.hs` shows how the `resolve` function
behaves. It expects to find `examples/moduleexports.Example.hs` and
`examples/moduleexports/Example/Internal.hs`.

```
% cabal exec -- runghc examples/ModuleExports.hs
Only example: fromList [(ModuleName () "Example",[])]
Only internal: fromList [(ModuleName () "Example.Internal",[Value {symbolModule = ModuleName () "Example.Internal", symbolName = Ident () "details"}])]
Example & Internal: fromList [(ModuleName () "Example",[Value {symbolModule = ModuleName () "Example.Internal", symbolName = Ident () "details"}]),(ModuleName () "Example.Internal",[Value {symbolModule = ModuleName () "Example.Internal", symbolName = Ident () "details"}])]
Internal & Example: fromList [(ModuleName () "Example",[Value {symbolModule = ModuleName () "Example.Internal", symbolName = Ident () "details"}]),(ModuleName () "Example.Internal",[Value {symbolModule = ModuleName () "Example.Internal", symbolName = Ident () "details"}])]
Example after Internal: fromList [(ModuleName () "Example",[Value {symbolModule = ModuleName () "Example.Internal", symbolName = Ident () "details"}]),(ModuleName () "Example.Internal",[Value {symbolModule = ModuleName () "Example.Internal", symbolName = Ident () "details"}])]
Internal after Example: fromList [(ModuleName () "Example",[]),(ModuleName () "Example.Internal",[Value {symbolModule = ModuleName () "Example.Internal", symbolName = Ident () "details"}])]
```


### API documentation

The core module you need is [Language.Haskell.Names][]

Other modules are more experimental, less documented, and you probably don't need
them anyway.
